# Exercise Set 3: Pratice with Functions and Loops
In this set of exercises we will focus on practicing making functions and using loops. You can write your solutions in a single file called `solutions3.py` and upload them to your fork of the repository.

1. Write a python function to find the maximum of three numbers.

2. Write a python funciton to check whether a number is in a given range.

3. Write a python funciton to create and print a list where the values are the squares of the numbers from 1 to 30 inclusive.

4. Write a python function to calculate the factorial of a number (a non-negative integer). The function accepts the number as an argument.

5. Write a python program to print the even numbers from a given list.  
    *Sample Input*:     [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  
    *Expected Result*:  [2, 4, 6, 8]  
    
6. Write a python function to sum all the numbers in a list.  
    *Sample Input*:     [8, 2, 3, 0, 7]  
    *Expected Result*:  20

7. Write a python funciton to multiply all the numbers in a list.  
    *Sample Input*:     [8, 2, 3, -1, 7]  
    *Expected Result*:  -336

8. Write a python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list.  
    *Sample Input*:     [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5]  
    *Expected Result*:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

9. Wrie a python function that takes a natural number greater than 1 and returns a list of its positive divisers except 1 and the number iself.  
    *Sample Input*:     18  
    *Expected Result*:  [2, 3, 6, 9]

10. Write a python function that takes a number as a parameter and checks if the number is prime or not. Note: a prime number (also called a "prime") is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

11. Write a python function to check whether a number is perfect or not.
> (From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number "Wikipedia")) In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluing the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself). ... *Examples:* The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalenty, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: (1 + 2 + 3 + 6) / 2 = 6. The next perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the perfect numbers 496 abd 8128.

12. Write a python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and a multiple of 5 between 1500 and 2700 inclusive.

13. Write a python program to play a guessing game with the user. First, the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 9. The program should then prompt the user to enter a guess. If the answer is wrong, the program will prompt the user to guess again until the answer is correct. Once the user guesses correctly, the program should print "Well guessed!" and then exit. 

14. Write a python program to construct the following patern using a nested for loop.  
\*  
\*\*  
\*\*\*  
\*\*\*\*  
\*\*\*\*\*  
\*\*\*\*  
\*\*\*

15. Write a python program to count the number of even and odd nubers from a list of numbers.
    *Sample Input*:     [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    *Expected Result*:  5 even numbers, 4 odd numbers

16. Write a python program to get the fibonacci series between 0 and 50 inclusive. Recall that the Fibonacci series begins with 0, 1, 1, 2, ... and that every number in the sequence is the sum of the two numbers that came before it (with the exception of the first two numbers).

17. Write a python program that iterates over the integers from 1 to 50 inclusive. For multiples of three, print "Fizz". For multiples of 5 the program should print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz". For numbers that are neither a multiple of 3 nor 5, print the number itself.  
*Expected Result*:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;1  
&nbsp;&nbsp;2  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fizz  
&nbsp;&nbsp;4  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Buzz  
&nbsp;&nbsp;...


18. Write a python program that takes two digits m (number of rows) and n (number of columns) as input and generates a two dimensional array (nested list). The element value in the ith row and jth column of the array should be i * j.  
    *Sample Input*:     m = 3, n = 4  
    *Expected Result*:  [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 2, 4, 6]]

19. Write a python program to check the validity of a password using the following rules:  
* At least 1 upper-case (A - Z) and 1 lower-case (a - z) letter
* At least 1 number between 0 and 9
* At least 1 of the following characters: $, #, or @
* Minimum length of 6 characters
* Maximum lenfth of 16 characters

20. Write a python prram to find numbers between 100 and 400 inclusive such that each digit of a number is an even number. The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma separated sequece.

**Good Luck!**
