# Exercise Repsitory

---

Hello! Welcome to the exercise repository for the reStart python class. Here you can find all of the exercise sets we have done so far in the class as markdown (.md) files. We encourage you to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) your own version of this repository where you can upload your solutions. It may take several weeks to get through each assignment, so try to commit and push your updated solution file at the end of every class. Make sure you [sync your repository](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) now and then to get updated/new assignments when they are uploaded to the master repository of the class. 

Current Assignments:
* `Exercises1.md` - Introductory exercises for python and terminal (provided by Tutors)
* `Exercises2.md` - Practice with if/else, operators, and lists (provided by Tutors)
* `Exercises3.md` - Practie with functions and loops (provided by Andreea)
