# Exercises sheet nÂ°2
This sheet is organized by topic. The exercises get harder as you go. You can jump from one topic to another as you want! Try to put all of your answers in a single file, "Solutions2.py" that you can push to your fork of the repository.

## If/Else Statements

1) Enumerate the 3 possible commands when using if/else statement.

2) Write a code that print "Hello World" if x is smaller than 4 and print "Goodbye" otherwise. Remember, you need to define x for your code to work. Try the code for a few different values of x to make sure it works correctly.

3) Assign a variable x to be an integer. Write a code that will print "One" if x is 1, "A couple" if x is 2, "Several" if x is 3, 4, or 5, and print "Many!" if x is greater than 5. 

4) Make an int variable called n. Write a code that tell you if that integer is an even or an odd number.

5) Make an int variable n. Write a code that prints the difference between 21 and n, if n is smaller or equal to 21,
or that prints two times n if n is over 21.

6) Same as code 5) but if n is over 21, print the absolute value of the difference between 21 and n.

## Operators

7) What is the symbol for addition? Subtraction? Multiplication?

8) What is the difference between < and <= ? Between > and  >= ? Between = and != ?

9) What is the difference between the operator a/b and a%b ? (with a and b two numbers) 

10) What is the difference between a = b and a == b?

11) Choose two numbers (integer or float) a and b.
Write a code that print on different lines : Addition (a + b), soustraction, multiplication, division,
modulus ( a%b if a is greater than b, else b%a)

### Lists

12) Create an empty list called emptiness

13) Add the numbers 2 and 34 to this list 

### Loops

14) Make an empty list called x. Write a for loop that for 20 iterations will add a random number to the list and then print the list.

15) My cat has a kitten every year. She had two babies for the moment, one just a week ago. Create a loop that tell me in how many years she would have had 15 kittens. (tip : use a while loop)

16) Let x be the number of fishes in a pond. At the begining, day 1, there are 5 fish. Everyday each fish will have 2 babies but only 25% of the babies will survive to be adults. Also, every day 2 fish are eaten. For simplicity, let's assume that the fish mature from babies to adults in within a day and that the 2 fish that are eaten are always eaten at the very end of the day. Write a script using loops to figure out how many days it will take until there are 100 fish.
