# Exercises sheet nÂ°2
This sheet is organized by topic. The exercises get harder as you go. You can jump from one topic to another as you want! Try to put all of your answers in a single file, "Solutions2.py" that you can push to your fork of the repository.

## If/Else Statements

1) Enumerate the 3 possible commands when using if/else Loop

2) Write a code that print "Hello World" if x is smaller than 4 and print "Goodbye" otherwise. Remember, you need to define x for your code to work. Try the code for a few different values of x to make sure it works correctly.

3) Assign a variable x to be an integer. Write a code that will print "One" if x is 1, "A couple" if x is 2, "Several" if x is 3, 4, or 5, and print "Many!" if x is greater than 5. 

4) Make an int variable called n. Write a code that tell you if that integer is an even or an odd number.

5) Make an int variable n. Write a code that prints the difference between 21 and n, if n is smaller or equal to 21,
or that prints two times n if n is over 21.

6) Same as code 5) but if n is over 21, print the absolute value of the difference between 21 and n.

## Operators

7) What is the symbol for addition? Subtraction? Multiplication?

8) What is the difference between < and <= ? Between > and  >= ? Between = and != ?

9) What is the difference between the operator a/b and a%b ? (with a and b two numbers) 

10) What is the difference between a = b and a == b?

11) Choose two numbers (integer or float) a and b.
Write a code that print on different lines : Addition (a + b), soustraction, multiplication, division,
modulus ( a%b if a is greater than b, else b%a)

### Lists

12) Create an empty list called list

13) Add the numbers 2 and 34 to this list 

### Loops

14) Create a loop that print the number from 1 to 20

15) Let x be the number of fishes in a pond. At day 1, there are 45 fishes, and each day two more appear, and one is eaten. Create a while loop giving the day on which the fish's population get to reach 152 individuals.

16) My cat has a kitten every year. She had two babies for the moment, one just a week ago.
Create a loop that tell me in how many years she would have had 15 kittens. (tip : use a while loop)
