This sheet is organized by topic. Exercises go harder. You can jump from one topic to another as you want!

## If/Else Loop

1) Enumerate the 3 possible commands when using if/else Loop

2) Write a code that print "Hello World" if x is smaller than 4 or else print "Goodbye".
If you tried to run the code, it didn't work because "x is not defined"
3) Now, make x equal to 3 at the beginning. Run your code and see what it prints.
Try different values for x.

4) Choose an int variable called n. Write a code that tell you if that integer is an even or an odd number at the end.

5) Choose an int variable n. Write a code that prints the difference between 21 and n, if n is smaller or equal to 21,
or that prints two times n if n is over 21.

6) Same as code 5) but if n is over 21, print the absolute value of the difference between 21 and n.

## Operators

7) What is the symbol for addition? Soustraction? Multiplication?

8) What is the difference between < and <= ? Between > and  >= ? Between = and != ?

9) What is the difference between the operator a/b and a%b ? (with a and b two numbers) 

10) What is the difference between a = b and a == b?

11) Choose two numbers (integer or float) a and b.
Write a code that print on different lines : Addition (a + b), soustraction, multiplication, division,
modulus ( a%b if a is greater than b, else b%a)

### Lists

12) Create an empty list called list

13) Add the numbers 2 and 34 to this list 

### Loops

14) Create a loop that print the number from 1 to 20

15) Let x be the number of fishes in a pond. At day 1, there are 45 fishes, and each day two more appear, and one is eaten. Create a while loop giving the day on which the fish's population get to reach 152 individuals.

16) My cat has a kitten every year. She had two babies for the moment, one just a week ago.
Create a loop that tell me in how many years she would have had 15 kittens. (tip : use a while loop)
